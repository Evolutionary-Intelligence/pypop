During Winter 2017, Qiqi Duan, as a Ph.D. candidate at SUSTech, Shenzhen,
Guangdong, China (joint with HIT, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China), chatted
with Hao Tong, as a Master candidate also in SUSTech, regarding the
necessarity of an open-source library for evolutionary algorithms (EAs)
and swarm-based optimizers (SOs). Clearly, it is a huge work to cover as
many as well-established and newly-emerging versions and variants of EAs
and SOs.
