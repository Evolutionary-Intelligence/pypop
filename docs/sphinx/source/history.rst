During Winter 2017, Qiqi Duan, when as a Ph.D. candidate at SUSTech, Shenzhen,
Guangdong, China (joint with HIT, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China), chat with Hao
Tong, as a Master candidate also in SUSTech, regarding the necessarity of an
open-source library for evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and swarm-based
optimizers. Clearly, it is a huge work to cover as many as well-established
