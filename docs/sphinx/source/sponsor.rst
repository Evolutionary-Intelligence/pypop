This open-source Python library for **large-scale black-box optimization** is supported by Shenzhen Fundamental
Research Program under Grant No. JCYJ20200109141235597 (2,000,000 Yuan granted to *Prof. Yuhui Shi* from CSE, Southern
University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) @ Shenzhen, China from 2021 to 2023), and actively developed by three
of his group members (**Qiqi Duan**, *Chang Shao*, and *Guochen Zhou*).

  * Now *Zhuowei Wang* from University of Technology Sydney (UTS) takes part in this library as one core developer (for
    testing).
  * Now *Mingyang Feng* from University of Birmingham (UoB) helps to search papers involved in this library and test on
    MacOS X.
  * Now *Yijun Yang* from UTS helps to suggest papers about Bayesian Optimization (BO).
  * Now *Qi Zhao* from SUSTech helps to proofread all the documents.
  * Now *Haobin Yang* from SUSTech helps to proofread all the documents.
  * Now *Minghan Zhang* from University of Warwick helps to search papers involved in this library and test on
    MacOS X.
  * Now *Zonghan He* from SUSTech helps to test the installation process on Windows10 OS.

We also acknowledge the initial (2017) discussions with Hao Tong (when at SUSTech) and recent (2022) discussions wih
Changwu Huang (at SUSTech).

Finally, we thank very much for all the following open-source code to make **repeatability** much easier (still updated):
