`"Responsible for adaptation, optimization, and innovation in the living world, evolution
executes a simple algorithm of diversifcation and natural selection, an algorithm that
works at all levels of complexity from single protein molecules to whole ecosystems."---
From Nobel Lecture of Frances H. Arnold in California Institute of Technology
<https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/10/arnold-lecture.pdf>`_

**PyPop7** is a *Pure-PYthon* library of *POPulation-based OPtimization* for single-objective,
real-parameter, black-box problems. Its design goal is to provide a *unified* interface and a
set of *elegant* implementations for **Black-Box Optimizers (BBO)**, particularly
**population-based optimizers** (including *evolutionary algorithms, swarm-based random
methods, and pattern search*), in order to facilitate research repeatability, benchmarking of
BBO, and especially real-world applications.

Specifically, for alleviating the well-known ("notorious") **curse of dimensionality** of BBO,
the primary focus of `PyPop7 <https://github.com/Evolutionary-Intelligence/pypop>`_ is to
cover their **State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) implementations for Large-Scale Optimization (LSO)** as
much as possible, though many of their *medium- or small-scale* versions and variants are also
included here (some mainly for *theoretical* purposes, some mainly for *educational* purposes,
some mainly for *benchmarking* purposes, and some mainly for *application* purposes on medium
or low dimensions).

.. note::
   This `open-source <https://www.gnu.org/>`_ Python library for **continuous** BBO is still under active maintenance.
   In the future, we plan to add some NEW BBO and some SOTA versions of existing BBO families, in order to make this
   library as fresh as possible. Any suggestions, extensions, improvements, usages, and tests (even *criticisms*) to
   this `open-source <https://opensource.org/>`_ Python library are highly welcomed!

   If this open-source pure-Python library **PyPop7** is used in your paper or project, it is highly welcomed but NOT
   mandatory to cite the following arXiv preprint paper: **Duan, Q., Zhou, G., Shao, C., Wang, Z., Feng, M., Huang,
   Y., Tan, Y., Yang, Y., Zhao, Q. and Shi, Y., 2024. PyPop7: A pure-Python library for population-based black-box
   optimization. arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.05652.** (Now this arXiv paper has been submitted to `JMLR
   <https://jmlr.org/>`_, **accepted** in Fri, 11 Oct 2024 after 3 reviews from Tue, 28 Mar 2023 to Wed, 01 Nov 2023
   to Fri, 05 Jul 2024.)

**Quick Start**

Three steps are often enough to utilize the potential of `PyPop7 <https://pypi.org/project/pypop7/>`_ for BBO in many
(though not all) cases:

1. Use `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_ to automatically install `pypop7` via `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_:

    .. code-block:: bash

       $ pip install pypop7

Please refer to `this online documentation <https://pypop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ for details
about *multiple* installation ways.

2. Define/code your own objective (aka cost or fitness) function (to be **minimized**) for the `complex
   <https://doi.org/10.1201/9780367802486>`_ optimization problem at hand:

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

       >>> import numpy as np  # for numerical computation, which is also the computing engine used by PyPop7
       >>> def rosenbrock(x):  # one notorious test function in the optimization community
       ...     return 100.0*np.sum(np.square(x[1:] - np.square(x[:-1]))) + np.sum(np.square(x[:-1] - 1.0))
       >>> ndim_problem = 1000  # problem dimension
       >>> problem = {'fitness_function': rosenbrock,  # fitness function to be minimized
       ...            'ndim_problem': ndim_problem,  # problem dimension
       ...            'lower_boundary': -5.0*np.ones((ndim_problem,)),  # lower search boundary
       ...            'upper_boundary': 5.0*np.ones((ndim_problem,))}  # upper search boundary

See `this online documentation <https://pypop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide.html>`_ for details about the
**problem definition**. Note that any *maximization* problem can be easily transformed into the *minimization*
problem via simply negating.

Please refer to `this online documentation <https://pypop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmarks.html>`_ for a
large set of benchmarking functions from different application fields, which have been provided by `PyPop7`.

3. Run one or more black-box optimizers (BBO) from `PyPop7` on the above optimization problem:

    .. code-block:: python
       :linenos:

       >>> from pypop7.optimizers.es.lmmaes import LMMAES  # or to choose any black-box optimizer you prefer in PyPop7
       >>> options = {'fitness_threshold': 1e-10,  # terminate when the best-so-far fitness is lower than 1e-10
       ...            'max_runtime': 3600,  # terminate when the actual runtime exceeds 1 hour (i.e., 3600 seconds)
       ...            'seed_rng': 0,  # seed of random number generation (which should be set for repeatability)
       ...            'x': 4.0*np.ones((ndim_problem,)),  # initial mean of search/mutation/sampling distribution
       ...            'sigma': 3.0,  # initial global step-size of search distribution (to be fine-tuned for optimality)
       ...            'verbose': 500}
       >>> lmmaes = LMMAES(problem, options)  # initialize the black-box optimizer (a unified interface for all optimizers)
       >>> results = lmmaes.optimize()  # run its (time-consuming) optimization/evolution/search process
       >>> # print best-so-far fitness and used function evaluations returned by the used black-box optimizer
       >>> print(results['best_so_far_y'], results['n_function_evaluations'])
       9.948e-11 2973386

Please refer to `this online documentation <https://pypop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide.html#optimizer-setting>`_
for details about the **optimizer setting**. The following **API** contents are given mainly for all currently available
BBO in this seemingly `increasingly popular <https://pypop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/applications.html>`_ open-source
Python library.

.. note::
   A total of four *extended* versions of PyPop7 (as PP7) are ongoing or
   planned for further development, as follows:

   * For Constrained Optimization (PyCoPop7 as PCP7),
   * For Noisy Optimization (PyNoPop7 as PNP7),
   * Enhancement via Parallel and Distributed Optimization (PyPop77 as PP77),
   * Enhancement via Meta-evolution based Optimization (PyMePop7 as PMP7).
