```PyPop``` is a *Pure-PYthon* library of **POPulation-based OPtimization** for real-parameter, black-box problems (**currently actively developed**). Its goal is to provide a *unified* interface and also *elegant* implementations for **Derivative-Free Optimization (DFO)**, *particularly population-based optimizers*, in order to facilitate research repeatability and also real-world applications.

</p>

For alleviating the notorious **curse of dimensionality** of DFO (based on *iterative sampling*), the main focus of ```PyPop``` is to cover their **State-Of-The-Art implementations for Large-Scale Optimization (LSO)**, though their other versions and variants may be also included here (e.g., for benchmarking purpose, for mixing purpose, and sometimes even for practical purpose).

## Research Support

This open-source Python library for black-box optimization is now supported by **Shenzhen Fundamental Research Program** under Grant No. JCYJ20200109141235597 (￥2,000,000), granted to **Prof. Yuhui Shi** (CSE, SUSTech @ Shenzhen, China), and actively developed (from 2021 to 2023) by his group members (e.g., **Qiqi Duan**, *Chang Shao*, *Guochen Zhou*, and Youkui Zhang).

We also acknowledge the initial discussions and Python code efforts (dating back to *about* 2017) from Hao Tong from the research group of **Prof. Yao** (CSE, SUSTech @ Shenzhen, China).
